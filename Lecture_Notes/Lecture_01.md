 * Difference between monitoring (immediate feedback) versus evealuation (after-the-fact for future improvement).

* [The Components of Program Evaluation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xZ-AlnTsg)
 * Needs assessment: What is the problem?
 * Program theory assessment: How, in theory, does the program fix the problem?
 * Process evaluation: Does the program work as planned?
 * Impact evaluation: Where the goals achieved? The magnitude?
 * Cost effectiveness: Given the magnitude and the cost, how does it compare to the alternatives?

 * Intervention:
   * Start with a problem.
    * Verify that the problem actually exists.
    * Generate a theory of why the problem exists.
    * Design the program.
    * Think about whether the solution is cost effective.
 
 * Program Evaluation:
   * Start with a question.
    * Verify that the question hasn't been answered.
    * State a hypothesis.
    * Design the evaluation.
    * Determine whether the value of the answer is worth the cost of the evaluation.
